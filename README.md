# Palette Updater
A simple console app for updating palette references in Rain World region files.

## How to use

Make a backup of the region folder you'll be editing before using this tool. I take no responsibility for messing up your region files if you didn't make any backups!


1. Extract the .zip file and run PaletteUpdater.exe.
2. You'll probably get a Windows SmartScreen warning, which you can safely ignore.
3. Copy and paste the path to your mods 'world' folder.
4. Select the region you want to manage.
5. Enter the old palette ID, followed by the one you want to replace it with.
6. Enter 'Y' to confirm and the tool will update all references of the old palette ID with the new one.

The following files will be updated:

- Properties.txt
- Room Templates
- Room Settings files
